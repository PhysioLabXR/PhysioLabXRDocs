****************************************************
Building ERP Classifier based on EEG and Pupil Size
****************************************************


In this tutorial, we will build a classifier that uses `event-related potentila <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-related_potential>`_ in
both EEG and pupil size for a `visual oddball task <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddball_paradigm>`_. The classifier
will be able to tell if the participant is looking at target object or a distractor.

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the basic operation of PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR`. We recommend you to go through
:ref:`the simple ERP tutorial with EEG <Simple ERP tutorial>`.
