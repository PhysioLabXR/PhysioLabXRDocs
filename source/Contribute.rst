To get started with PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR` development, you will want to run the app from source. The following section will
guide you through the process of running the app from source.

Running PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR` from source is the best way to develop and test the app. Follow these steps to run the app
from source:

1. You need python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 installed on your computer. You can download python from `python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

2. Clone the project from `its repo page <https://github.com/physiolabxr/physiolabxr>`_. Unzip it.

3. Install the required packages, we recommend using a virtual environment so that the packages installed for PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR`
don't conflict with other python projects on your computer. Here's how to do it with ``pip``
and `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_.

    * In terminal, cd to the root directory of cloned PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR` and run ``python -m venv venv``
      This will create a virtual environment named ``venv`` in the root directory of PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR`.
    * Note that you don't have to create the venv in the root directory of PhysioLab\ :sup:`XR`, you can create it anywhere
      you want. If you do, you need to change the path in the following steps accordingly.
    * Activate the virtual environment by running ``source venv/bin/activate`` on MacOS/Linux or ``venv\Scripts\activate.bat`` on Windows.
    * Install the required packages by running ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. If you run into troubles installing the packages, please refer to the :ref:`Troubleshooting <troubleshooting>` page.

.. note::

    There is a known issue on installing on Windows. If you encounter the error **'Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required.'**,
    please refer to the :ref:`this troubleshoot topic <ms visual c++>` for a solution.

4. With packages installed (either in your base or in the virtual environment), from inside the cloned directory, run the following command to navigate to the physiolabxr directory:

    .. code-block::

        cd physiolabxr

5. Run the following command to start the app:

    .. code-block::

        python PhysioLabXR.py

.. note::

    Some test cases such as the benchmarking test cases require additional packages. To install these additional packages,
    you need to run the following command::

       pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
